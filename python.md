### What is python?
It's a high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. It is an 
open source, interpreted, objected-oriented programming language. Python was 
created by a Dutch programmer, Guido van Rossum. 

It's a programming language which is very close to human language and because of 
that it is easy to learn and use. Python is used by various industries and 
companies (including Google). It has been used to develop web applications, 
desktop applications, system adminstration, and machine learning libraries. Python 
is highly embraced language in the data science and machine learning community.

### Python Shell
Python is an interpreted scripting language, which means that it's executed line by 
line. The Python Shell is used to execute a single python command and get the result.

To use the Python Shell in the terminal, write:
```bash
python3
```
To exit, use:
```bash
exit()
```

#### Basic Python

##### Python Indentation
An indentation is a white space in a text. Indentation in many languages is used to 
increase code readability, however Python uses indentation to create block of codes.

##### Syntax

```python
# Symbols

+ # Addition
- # Substraction
* # Multiplication
/ # Division
// # Floor division operator, removes remainder
% # Modulus (Finding the remainder)
^ # Exponential operator
** # Exponential operator
```

###### Data types

To check data type of [x]:
```bash
type([x])
```

```python
# Strings and comments

'string' # Both creates a string
"string"

'''multiple''' # This creates a multi line string
'line string' 

"""This is a multiline
comment."""
```

```python
# Number

# Integer - without decimals 
# Float - with decimals
# Complex - ej. 1+j...
```

```python
# Booleans

# Boolean data type is either True or False
```

```python
# List

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # all are the same data types
['Banana', 'Orange', 'Mango', 'Avocado'] # all the same data types
['Finland','Estonia', 'Sweden','Norway'] # all the same data types
['Banana', 10, False, 9.81] # different data types in the list
```

```python
# Dictionary 

# Dictionary is an unordered collection of data in a key value pair format.
{
'first_name':'Asabeneh',
'last_name':'Yetayeh',
'country':'Finland', 
'age':250, 
'is_married':True,
'skills':['JS', 'React', 'Node', 'Python']
}
```

```python
# Tuple

"""Tuple is an ordered collection of different data types like list but tuples can not 
be modified once they are created. They are immutable."""

('Asabeneh', 'Pawel', 'Brook', 'Abraham', 'Lidiya')
```

```python
# Set

"""A set is a collection of data types similar to list and tuple. 
Set is not an ordered collection of items."""

{2, 4, 3, 5}
```
